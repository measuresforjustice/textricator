# ![Textricator](./textricator-logo-text.svg)

_Textricator_ is a tool to extract text from documents and generate structured data.

_Textricator_ is released under the
[GNU Affero General Public License Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

`io.mfj.textricator.Textricator` is the main entry point for library usage.

`io.mfj.textricator.cli.TextricatorCli` is the command-line interface.

The CLI has three subcommands, to use the three main features of Textricator:
  * text - Extract text from the PDF and generate JSON.
  * table - Parse the text that is in columns and rows. See [Table](#table) section.
  * form - Parse the text with a configured finite state machine. See [Form](#form) section.

### Extractors

Extractors extract text (instances of `io.mfj.textricator.text.Text`) from a source.
There are four included extractors:

  * _pdf.pdfbox_ - Extract text from PDF files using [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org).
  * _pdf.itext5_ - Extract text from PDF files using [iText 5](https://itextpdf.com/itext-5-core).
  * _pdf.itext7_ - Extract text from PDF files using [iText 7](https://itextpdf.com/itext-7-core).
  * _json_ - Parse text from the JSON format generated by the "text" subcommand of the CLI and by
  `io.mfj.textricator.Textricator.parseText()`.
  
Other extractors modules may be loaded, which may support different source types,
capture different information or split the text up differently.
An extractor module is loaded by adding a properties file
`io/mfj/textricator/extractor/textExtractor.properties` to the classpath with a single property -
the key is the extractor name and the value is the fully-qualified class name of an implementation of
`io.mfj.textricator.extractor.TextExtractorFactory`.
Typically an extractor module will be distributed as a JAR that includes `textExtractor.properties`.

Indicate which extractor to use by setting `extractor` in the yaml configuration,
or overriding it by passing the extractor name to the `inputFormat`/`--input-format` option.
If the extractor is not specified and the input is PDF, `pdf.itext5` is used.

## Table

In table mode, the data is grouped into columns based on the x-coordinate of the text.

### Example

```yaml
# All measurements are in points. 1 point = 1/72 of an inch.
# x-coordinates are from the left edge of the page.
# y-coordinates are from the top edge of the page.

# Use the "pdf.myCustomExtractor" extractor, which has been loaded from a custom JAR.
extractor: "pdf.myCustomExtractor"

# Ignore everything above 85pt from the top
top: 85

# Ignore everything below 553pt from the top
bottom: 553

# ignore to the right of 720pt from the left edge.
right: 720

# There is no "left", because everything to the left of the first column is ignored.

pageConfig:
  1:
    # On page 1, ignore everything above 100pt from the top. Overrides top:85 above.
    top: 100
     # could also define bottom and right here.
  123:
    # skip page 123 entirely.
    skip: true
     
# If multiple text segments are withing 2pt vertically, consider them in the same row.
maxRowDistance: 2

# Define the columns, based on the x-coordinate where the column starts:
cols:
  "bookingNum": 27
  "name": 83
  "class": 247
  "sex": 359
  "race": 389
  "dob": 420
  "bookDate": 475
  "arrestingOfficer": 545
  "releaseDate": 689
  
types:
  # Set bookingNum type so it can be used in filter
  "bookingNum":
    type: "integer"
    
  # Do not include arrestingOffcier
  "arrestingOfficer":
    include: "false"
    
  "bookDate":
    label: "Booking Date"
    
  # Replace "M" with "Male", "F" with "Female"
  "sex":
    replacements:
      -
        pattern: "M"
        replacement: "Male"
      -
        pattern: "F"
        replacement: "Female"
      -
        pattern: "^(.*)$"
        replacement: "Unknown: $1"

# Omit if bookingNum is negative
filter: 'bookingNum > 0'
```

## Form

In form mode, the data is parsed by Textricator using a
[finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) (FSM),
and the FSM and additional parsing and formatting parameters are configured with
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), indicated by command line option `--config`.

### Conditions

State transitions are selected by evaluating conditions. Conditions are expressions parsed by
[Expr](https://github.com/measuresforjustice/expr).

#### Available variables:

  * `ulx`
  * `uly`
  * `lrx`
  * `lry`
  * `text`
  * `page`
  * `page_prev` - page number of the previous text
  * `fontSize`
  * `font`
  * `color`
  * `bgcolor`
  * `width`
  * `height`
  * `ulx_rel` - difference in `ulx` between the previous and current texts
  * `uly_rel` - difference in `uly` between the previous and current texts
  * `lrx_rel` - difference in `lrx` between the previous and current texts
  * `lry_rel` - difference in `lry` between the previous and current texts
  * [added Variables](#variables)

### Example

This is an example for `examples/school-employee-list.pdf`.

```yaml
# Use the built-in PDF parser
extractor: "pdf.pdfbox"

# All measurements are in points. 1 point = 1/72 of an inch.
# x-coordinates are from the left edge of the page.
# y-coordinates are from the top edge of the page.
header:
    # ignore anything less than this many points from the top, default and per-page
  default: 130
footer:
    # ignore anything less than this many points from the bottom, default and per-page
  default: 700

# Text segments are generally parsed in order, top to bottom, left to right.
# If two text segments have y-coordinates within this many points, consider them on the same line,
# and process the one further left first, even if it is 0.4pt lower on the page.
maxRowDistance: 2

# Define the output data record.
# Since the main record type we're collecting information on is our employees,
# we'll have that be the root type for our harvested information.
rootRecordType: employee
recordTypes:
  employee:
    label: "employee" # Labels are used when nested recordTypes come into play, like this document.
    valueTypes:
      # Not sure what to name a valueType? Just make something up!
      - employee
      - name
      - hiredate
      - occupation
      - showinfo
      - bool1
      - bool2
      - bool3
      - salary
    children:
      # In this example, there are multiple children nested under an employee,
      # so we'll treat it as a 'child' to the 'employee' recordType.
      - child
  child:
    label: "child"
    valueTypes:
      - child
      - grade

valueTypes:
  employee:
    # In the CSV, use "Employee ID" as the column header instead of "employee".
    label: "Employee ID"
  name:
    label: "Name"
  hiredate:
    label: "Hire Date"
  occupation:
    label: "Occupation"
  salary:
    label: "Salary"
  showinfo:
    label: "Important Info?"
  bool1:
    label: "Boolean 1"
  bool2:
    label: "Boolean 2"
  bool3:
    label: "Boolean 3"
  child:
    label: "Attending Child"
  grade:
    label: "Grade"

# Now we define the finite-state machine
# Let's name the state that our machine starts off with:
initialState: "INIT"

# When each text segment is encountered, each transition for the current state is checked.
states:
  INIT:
    transitions:
      # The first bit of text we reach is 'ID-0001', so we'll try the only transition that should work here.
      -
        # If this condition matches (which it should)
        condition: employee # Curious about the condition? Sxroll further down to the conditions section of this YAML.
        # Then we'll switch to the 'employee' state!
        nextState: employee

  employee: # ID number with the format 'ID-####'
    startRecord: true # When we enter this stage, we'll create a new "case" record.
    transitions:
      - # Now we move on to the name label. Once again, by varifying the condition and moving on after that.
        condition: namelabel
        nextState: namelabel

# Here we define the conditions:
conditions:

  # An example of comparing text with regex.
  # In this case, we're making sure that the text contains the characters 'ID-' followed by any amount of numbers.
  employee: 'text =~ /ID-(\\d)*/'

  # You can match based on the x- and y- coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners of the rectangle
  # containing the text. ulx = Upper-Left X-coordinate. lry = Lower-Right Y-coordinate. Also uly and lrx.
  # You can define the lower and upper limit for each, inclusive.
  namelabel: '70 < ulx < 80 and font = "BCDFEE+Calibri-Bold"'

  # You can also match based on the type of font used, including if it was bolded or italicized.
  name: '112 < ulx < 200 and font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  hiredateLabel: '230 < ulx < 270 and font = "BCDFEE+Calibri-Bold"'

  hiredate: '280 < ulx < 290 and font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  occupationLabel: '391 < ulx < 393 and font = "BCDFEE+Calibri-Bold"'

  occupation: '394 < ulx < 700 and font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  showinfo: 'font = "BCDJEE+Georgia"'

  notinfo:  'font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  bool1:  'font = "BCDIEE+Cambria"'

  bool2:  'font = "BCDIEE+Cambria"'

  bool3:  'font = "BCDIEE+Cambria"'

  childLabel: '230 < ulx < 240 and font = "BCDFEE+Calibri-Bold"'

  child: '230 < ulx < 380 and font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  gradeLabel: '391 < ulx < 393 and font = "BCDFEE+Calibri-Bold"'

  grade: '394 < ulx < 700 and font = "BCDEEE+Calibri"'

  # You can also match based on the size of the font and on specific text.
  end: 'fontSize = 16.0 and text = "TOTAL:"'

  # Need a condition that is always true? "1=1" does that for you.
  any: "1 = 1"
```

### Advanced functionality

#### Regex matching

You can use regular expression matching instead of exact string matching in conditions:

```yaml
conditions:
  caseTypeLabel: 'text =~ /Case Type:?/' # maybe sometimes they forgot the ":"
```

#### Font matching

You can match font and font size:

```yaml
conditions:
  helvetica8: 'font =~ /.*Helvetica.*/ and fontSize = 8'
```

#### Page number matching

You can match the page number

```yaml
conditions:
  # Match the textbox that starts at 100pt,120pt on page 9.
  specificTextbox: 'page = 9 and ulx = 100 and uly = 120'
```

#### Requiring intermediate state

There may be cases where you want to transition from state "B" to state "A" and start a new record,
but ONLY if you were in state "C" since last starting a new record:

```yaml
states:
  A:
    startRecord: true
    startRecordRequiredState: C
    # ...
```

#### Combining states

You may have 2 different states that you want to combine into one column in the output:

```yaml
recordTypes:
  record:
    label: "Record"
    valueTypes:
      - A
      # no A2
      - B

states:
  A:
    # ...
  A2:
    valueTypes: [ A ] # combine this with state "A".
    # ...
```

#### Joining text segments in a state

When there are multiple text segments in the same state, by default they are concatenated with a space in between.
Any string, including an empty string, can be used as the separator:

```yaml
valueTypes:
  recordId:
    # concatenate without spaces between
    label: "Record ID"
    separator: ""
  description:
    # put newlines between text segments
    label: "Description"
    separator: "
"
```

#### Exclude types from output

A value type (`dataRecordMember`) can be excluded from the output.
This is useful if the type is repeated on the PDF and needed as a data type to set new records,
but should not be in the output.

```yaml
valueTypes:
  repeatedId:
    include: false
```
#### Relative offsets

Conditions can evaluate coordinates relative to the coordinates of the previous text.
This is useful for matching only something on the next line:

```yaml
maxRowDistance: 2
conditions:
  # These should generally be the same (absolute value) as maxRowDistance
  descriptionSameLine: '-2 <= uly_rel <= 2'
  descriptionOneLineDown: '12 <= uly_rel <= 16' # for 12pt, single-spaced font.
```

#### Control which page number in output

If a complex data record spans multiple pages, which page number is used for the output can be controlled.
Each type (`dataRecordType`) has a page priority (default: 0).
The page number for the record comes from the type with the highest priority.

```yaml
recordTypes:
  agency:
    label: "Agency"
    valueTypes:
      - agencyName
    children:
      - case
    # Agency may span hundreds of pages
    # default page priority of 0
  case:
    label: "Case"
    valueTypes:
      - caseNumber
      - name
    children:
      - charge
    # Case record may span multiple pages.
    # Higher priority than agency but lower than charges,
    so case is used if there are no charges.
    pagePriority: 1
  charge:
    label: "Charge"
    valueTypes:
      - chargeNumber
    # Highest priority. Use charge's page number.
    pagePriority: 2
```

#### Starting new records for each value

TODO

#### Regex replacement of values

Sometimes the value contains a label, or other text you want to remove.
In a `dataRecordMember`, add a `replacement`, which has a `pattern`,
which is a regular expression with capturing groups,
and `replacement`, which is a replacement string with group references.
See `java.util.regex.Pattern` and `java.util.regex.Matcher` for details.

```yaml
# Replace "Bond Agency: Fred's Bonds" with "Fred's Bonds"
valueTypes:
  bondagency:
    label: "Bond Agency"
    replacements:
      -
        pattern: "Bond Agency:\ *(.*)"
        replacement: "$1"
```

#### Variables<a name="variables"></a>

On entering a state, a variable can be set.

In `State`, add a `setVariable`, which has `name` of the variable and the `value` to set.

If the `value` starts with `{` and ends with `}`, the content can be any built-in variable or previously
set `variable` - the same things usable as variables for conditions.

For example: a condition checks that has the same background color as the last caseNo:

```yaml
states:
  caseNo:
    setVariables:
      -
        name: "lastCaseBgColor"
        value: "{bgcolor}"
        
conditions:
  sameBgColor: >
    145 <= ulx
    and fontSize = 8
    and bgcolor = lastCaseBgColor
```

#### Splitting one PDF field into multiple CSV columns

One field in the PDF can be broken up into multiple columns in the CSV file, based on 
different regular expressions and replacements:

```yaml
# Take a field that contains lastName,firstName and split it into 2 fields - lastName and firstName
recordTypes:
  inmateName:
    label: "inmateName"
    valueTypes:
      - lastName
      - firstName
    
valueTypes:
  lastName:
    label: "Last Name"
    replacements:
      -
        # lastName column will contain what's before comma
        pattern: "(.*),.*"
        replacement: "$1"
  firstName:
    label: "First Name"
    replacements:
      -
        # firstName column will contain what's after comma
        pattern: ".*,(.*)"
        replacement: "$1" 
    
states:
  name:
    # when FSM hits state "name", split data into lastName and firstName
    valueTypes:
      - lastName
      - firstName
```

#### Filtering records

Records can be filtered before output by setting a filter on the `dataRecordType`. Root records
with a non-matching filter will not be output. Child records with a non-matching filter will
be removed from their parent - the root will still be output.

Filters are expressions parsed by
[Expr](https://github.com/measuresforjustice/expr)

The variables are the fields in the record. The default type for variables is `STRING`.
The type can be set by setting `type` in the `dataRecordMember` to `string`, `integer`, or `double`.

```yaml
recordTypes:
  case:
    label: "Case"
    # Only include cases in 2009-2013
    filter: "2009 <= year <= 2013"
    valueTypes:
      - year
      - name
    children:
      - charge
  charge:
    label: "Charge"
    # omit charges of type "dummy"
    filter: >
      not( type = "dummy" )
    valueTypes:
      - code
      - type

valueTypes:
  year:
    type: integer
```

Filtering happens after replacements and before member include checking.
This allows splitting a field (e.g.: extracting a year from a date)
to use in the filter, and not including the split field in the output.
